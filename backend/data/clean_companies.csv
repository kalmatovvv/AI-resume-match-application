Tecton,2019.0,,information technology & services,Series C,http://www.tecton.ai,,"Founded by the team that created the Uber Michelangelo platform, Tecton provides an enterprise-ready AI data platform to help companies activate their data for AI applications. AI creates new opportunities to generate more value than ever before from data. Companies can now build AI-driven applications to automate decisions at machine speed, deliver magical customer experiences, and re-invent business processes. But AI models will only ever be as good as the data that is fed to them. Today, it's incredibly hard to build and manage AI data. Most companies don't have access to the advanced AI data infrastructure that is used by the Internet giants. So AI teams spend the majority of their time building bespoke data pipelines, and most models never make it to production. We believe that companies need a new kind of data platform built for the unique requirements of AI. Tecton enables AI teams to easily and reliably compute, manage, and retrieve data for both generative AI and predictive ML applications. Our platform delivers features, embeddings, and prompts as rich, unified context, abstracting away the complex engineering involved in data preparation for AI. With Tecton, companies can: 1. Productionize context faster, getting new models to production 80% faster 2. Build more accurate models through rapid data experimentation and 100% accurate context serving 3. Drive down production costs by turning expensive workloads into highly efficient data services We believe that by getting the data layer for AI right, companies can get better models to production faster, driving real business outcomes. Tecton enables organizations to harness the full potential of their data, creating AI applications that are contextually aware and truly intelligent."

CONTINUUS Pharmaceuticals,2012.0,,pharmaceuticals,Series B,http://www.continuuspharma.com,,"CONTINUUS' mission is to produce high-quality drugs that can be delivered to patients more effectively and at a lower cost. In achieving this goal, we look to radically transform the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, steering it away from outdated batch systems to state-of-the-art continuous processes. CONTINUUS is leveraging a novel continuous manufacturing platform called Integrated Continuous Manufacturing (ICM), initially developed through an $85 M joint research project between Novartis and MIT. With ICM, we will improve affordability and accessibility of pharmaceuticals on a global scale. Our work is critical because the current manufacturing systems are time- and cost-inefficient, and are beset with quality problems. It is not unusual for manufacturing lead times, from start to finish, to be over one year, and studies have shown that the industry loses over $50 B annually due to wasteful processes. More importantly, these problems impact patient care. Hundreds of drugs are placed on the US FDA drug shortage website, many of which are life-saving (e.g., oncology drugs). To solve these problems, we offer a number of solutions. To achieve our goals, CONTINUUS has assembled a team of talented engineers and scientists, with skills ranging from analytical chemistry to drug formulation. Rather than producing medicines through batch-wise, step-by-step processes, ICM allows for fully continuous and automated operations, where the synthesis of the active ingredient and the final dosage form are integrated into a seamless process. This novel method will allow ""on-demand"" manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, improving affordability and accessibility of pharmaceuticals on a global scale."

Our initial focus is on diseases of the heart and the nervous system, where we foresee a generational change in the treatment paradigm similar to what has happened in the treatment of cancers. This is because advances in science are identifying new genes associated with diseases of the heart and the nervous system, making a compelling case for genetic medicines.

Delivering on our commitment to improve quality of life by changing the way healthcare is delivered, our multidisciplinary team of scientists, clinicians, engineers, and software architects has developed the Intra-Operative Positioning System (IOPS™). This mobile and affordable GPS-like 3D vascular navigation system allows for greater surgical precision and control than ever before, improving device placement accuracy, simplifying complex procedures, and potentially decreasing endoleaks and costly secondary interventions. Millions of vascular procedures are performed each year with minimally invasive, endovascular procedures frequently preferred over open surgical repair. Currently, to navigate within vessels physicians rely on x-ray fluoroscopy. This technology has several critical limitations, including lack of soft tissue visualization and exposure to harmful ionizing radiation. IOPS™, which fits directly into existing workflows and operating rooms, eliminates this excessive radiation exposure by creating manipulable 3D models of the relevant anatomy. These intelligent models are created from existing imaging that is already part of the standard of care. Centerline Biomedical, Inc. was founded in 2014 as a spinoff of the Cleveland Clinic to commercialize our innovative vascular navigation technology. With a research, development, and design history rooted in the Clinic's world-class Lerner Research Institute's Heart and Vascular Institute, the IOPS™ platform can be further used for predictive modeling, clinical decision support, global healthcare analytics and the education and training of future surgeons and interventionists.

Satelytics,2009.0,,information technology & services,Series B,http://www.satelytics.com,,"Satelytics is a cloud-based geospatial analytics software suite built to analyze terabytes of imagery to produce actionable insights. We specifically focus on providing timely, actionable alerts to our industrial customers in the oil & gas, power, mining, and water/wastewater sectors. Customers employ these alerts to direct field teams to act on operational anomalies before those anomalies cause extensive environmental damage and before they result in additional operational costs. Satelytics ingests multispectral or hyperspectral imagery gathered from satellites, aerial platforms, or fixed cameras, then processes these large data sets with algorithms designed to hunt for specific spectral signatures that indicate a problem. Satelytics is capable of delivering alerts on hydrocarbon leaks, saltwater leaks, methane leaks, encroachment threats, land movement, remediation progress, vegetation growth/health/speciation, water quality/chemistry, chemical constituents on land, and thermal changes. Whether sampling a 2-acre pond, 15,000 square miles of an oil & gas field, or 1,000 linear miles of electrical transmission lines, Satelytics can scale with business needs. With a single dataset, we can analyze for a variety of business unit interests by simultaneously running all the algorithms in our basket. The cost to the customer is the same whether we run a single algorithm of interest or the entire basket. The cost is the same whether alerts are delivered to one individual or every user in the enterprise."

Our initial focus is on diseases of the heart and the nervous system, where we foresee a generational change in the treatment paradigm similar to what has happened in the treatment of cancers. This is because advances in science are identifying new genes associated with diseases of the heart and the nervous system, making a compelling case for genetic medicines.
